We interact with the seat application through MQTT messages to emulate the behavior of an offboard application.
To see the responses from the seat adjuster app, subscribe to MQTT topics `seatadjuster/#``.

```bash
mosquitto_sub -t 'seatadjuster/#' -v
```

To initiate the moving of the seat, publish an MQTT message for the seat adjuster application to set the position to `1000` (which is the equivalent of 100%):

```bash
mosquitto_pub -t seatadjuster/setPosition/request -m '{"position": 1000, "requestId": "12345"}'
```

You may need to open a second terminal session to send the message.
In the QEMU setup, you can do this through an SSH connection from the host machine by running `ssh -p 2222 root@localhost`.

After publishing the setPosition-message, the expected output for the `seatadjuster/#` subscription should look like this:

```bash
seatadjuster/setPosition/request {"position": 1000, "requestId": "12345"}
seatadjuster/setPosition/response {"requestId": "12345", "result": {"status": 0, "message": "Set Seat position to: 1000"}}
seatadjuster/currentPosition {"position": 00}
seatadjuster/currentPosition {"position": 10}
seatadjuster/currentPosition {"position": 20}
seatadjuster/currentPosition {"position": 30}
seatadjuster/currentPosition {"position": 40}
seatadjuster/currentPosition {"position": 50}
...
```

If you encounter an issue or want to look deeper into the state of the container, you can check the logs by executing:

```bash
kanto-cm --name <container-name> logs
```

To ensure that the seatservice and the KUKSA Databroker are running well, you can use a simple client in the Leda image
instead of the seat application to set the target seat position:

```bash
sdv-ctr-exec -n seatservice-example /app/bin/seat_svc_client <position>
```

The [`sdv-ctr-exec`](https://eclipse-leda.github.io/leda/docs/general-usage/utilities/sdv-ctr-exec/) here acts as a wrapper around the `ctr` command
from containerd used by Eclipse Kanto.

Besides trusting the log information and the MQTT messages that the seat position in the KUKSA Databroker has changed you can read the values
directly from the KUKSA Databroker with the KUKSA Client.
Through the `sdv-ctr-exec` it becomes possible to interact with the CLI of the Eclipse KUKSA Client:

```bash
kanto-cm create --i --t --network=host --name=kuksa-client ghcr.io/eclipse/kuksa.val/kuksa-client:master
kanto-cm start --name=kuksa-client
sdv-ctr-exec -n kuksa-client /kuksa-client/bin/kuksa-client --port 30555 --protocol grpc --insecure
```

Congratulations, you have reached the end of the seat adjuster guide. Based on the used code, you can now continue to realize other applications by using other signals.
In addition, you can [connect the seat service to a CAN-environment](/can-seat-adjuster).
